        <h1 class="heading">General Information</h1>
        <p class="text">The beginning of video game consoles did not start as most would think. They were created in the early 1960s as a means to escape the mundane routines of massive computers. With almost every average home having a television, some companies sought to take advantage of this new invention. An engineer named Ralph Baer would be the first to create what is known as a video game console and developed the Magnavox Odyssey in 1972. The purpose of this was to provide families with hours of family-friendly fun.</p>
        <h1 class="heading">The Impact of Video Game Consoles</h1>
        <h2 class="subHeading">Society</h2>
        <p class="text">With the advent of video game consoles, this would affect society in many ways. Firstly, this would give individuals more reasons to get together, whether they are friends or family. This would also create friendly competition that would bring people together. Today, these friendly competitions have turned into major events called Esports events.</p>
        <p class="text">Additionally, video game consoles would provide another way to teach. While traditional classroom methods work for some, others prefer a more hands-on approach. Video game consoles would offer a more hands-on experience than sitting in a classroom reading a book.</p>
        <h2 class="subHeading">Politics</h2>
        <p class="text">When someone thinks about video game consoles and politics, one may think of copyright and business laws. However, this is not the only case. Many politicians try to heavily regulate or even outright outlaw all types of game consoles because they are deemed a negative influence on people. Many politicians will try to blame video games, alongside firearms, as the reason for hate crimes and mass murders. The belief is if people will do it in Call of Duty or Grand Theft Auto, they will do it outside the game as well. While there are studies that will show both sides, there is no definitive proof that video game consoles cause hate crimes or mass murders.</p>
        <h2 class="subHeading">Economy</h2>
        <p class="text">With the invention of video game consoles, this would create a new source of income for many people. Firstly, many companies will make far more money because of this, as it will be something new and something everyone wants. For the general public, there will be a need for people to develop these consoles and develop games for them. This will create new jobs for individuals that did not exist until the creation of video game consoles. Lastly, people will later want to collect these items as they were part of their childhood. This would create another form of collection, similar to collecting baseball cards or coins.</p>
        <h1 class="heading">Conclusion</h1>
        <p class="text">Were video game consoles a good invention? If you ask this avid gamer and inspiring game developer, they would answer maybe. This invention for the most part did not harm the environment directly. What others do with the product after they are finished with them is on the consumer, not the product or inventor. They create a new culture that is about bonding and having a good time together. However, this same culture turned into cyberbullying in many cases. Video game consoles are all about having fun, relieving stress after a long day at school or work, and expressing oneself. It is the same as firearms, firearms cannot kill people without another person pulling the trigger. With this said, if this were a perfect world, video games would have been the perfect invention of competition and gathering. However, where there is good, there must always be evil.</p>
